=============
_Creating a pocket sized toolkit library for any situation._

Purpose
-------
Hacking together libraries from all over the place can be tiring.
Also, the knowledge gained from the creation of a library is beneficial.
Both of these factors have lead to the development of the utilities in this self-contained library.
